Welcome to my Github profile!

I am a Frankfurt-based data scientist. Currently working at ING (https://github.com/ing-bank)

At the time of writing, you won't find much very exciting here. Mainly tutorials and/or small side projects that I had to abort for lack of time. The heavy toll of parenthood and full-time employment ðŸ˜„
